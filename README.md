# Hogwarts School

This project is for lab 03. I made responsive horizontal cards and you scroll the content with a mouse and touchpad horizontally and virtually also you can filter the Cards with house names and set a number of cards to display through two buttons, the website is also mobile-friendly.

In this project, I learned a lot about styling with CSS and scripting with Javascript, and it took me about one day and a half to finish.
